# Role Switching Protocol

## Purpose
To ensure all role switches (e.g., between Project Owner, Manager, Lead Developer, Prompt Designer, AI Specialist) are intentional, documented, and justified.

## Steps

1. **Trigger Role Switch**
   - Identify need for role switch (e.g., ambiguity, error, escalation, new task).
2. **Document Rationale**
   - Log reason for switch in `templates/Role_Switch_Log_Template.md`.
3. **Diagnostics Entry**
   - Update diagnostics log to reflect role switch.
4. **Protocol Compliance**
   - Reference relevant protocols and instructions for guidance.
5. **Escalation**
   - If unable to resolve autonomously, activate Prompt Designer protocol and seek user input.
