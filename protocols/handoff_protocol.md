2. **Code Review**: Conduct a thorough code review with the incoming team members to ensure understanding of the codebase.
3. **Meeting**: Schedule a handoff meeting with all stakeholders to discuss project history, current status, and future plans.
4. **Access**: Ensure that all necessary access rights to repositories, servers, and documentation are transferred to the new team.

## Onboarding Procedures
1. **Introduction**: Provide an overview of the project, team members, and roles.
2. **Training**: Schedule training sessions on tools and technologies used in the project.
3. **Mentorship**: Assign a mentor from the outgoing team to assist the new team during the transition.

## Continuity Practices
1. **Regular Check-Ins**: Schedule regular check-ins for the first few months to ensure the new team is on track and to address any concerns.

3. **Archiving**: Archive all project-related information and ensure it is well-organized for future reference.

## Conclusion
