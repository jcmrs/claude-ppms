# PR #1 Semantic Versioning Correction

## Required Action
The title of PR #1 needs to be manually updated to include a semantic versioning prefix as required by the problem statement.

## Current Title
```
Enhance changelog CI workflow with comprehensive diagnostics and security features
```

## Required Corrected Title  
```
Release v1.0.0: Enhance changelog CI workflow with comprehensive diagnostics and security features
```

## Rationale
- The problem statement specifically requires "Auto-correct PR #1 title to include a valid semantic version prefix (e.g., "Release v1.0.0:")"
- This change enables proper changelog workflow automation
- Follows semantic versioning conventions for release management
- Aligns with the project's autonomous changelog maintenance protocols

## Implementation Status
- ✅ **Automated enforcement created** - New PRs will be automatically validated
- ✅ **Validation script implemented** - `scripts/pr-title-validator.sh` can validate any PR title
- ✅ **Workflow enforcement added** - `.github/workflows/semantic-versioning.yml` will comment on non-compliant PRs
- ⚠️ **Manual correction needed** - PR #1 title must be updated manually by a user with write access

## Validation
Run the following command to verify the corrected title:
```bash
./scripts/pr-title-validator.sh "Release v1.0.0: Enhance changelog CI workflow with comprehensive diagnostics and security features"
```

Expected output: ✅ PR title has valid semantic versioning prefix

## Next Steps
1. A repository maintainer should update PR #1 title to include the "Release v1.0.0:" prefix
2. All future PRs will be automatically validated and guided by the enforcement workflow
3. The changelog CI workflow will function properly with semantic versioning in place
