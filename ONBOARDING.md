# Onboarding Guide: Claude-PPMS

This repository is designed for autonomous project management by GitHub Copilot and Claude.AI. The onboarding flow below enables any AI or human maintainer to continue work seamlessly.

## Steps

1. **Review `PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md`** for project goals and context.
2. **Check `.github/` directory** for workflow automation, issue templates, and contribution guidelines.
3. **Consult `PROMPTS.md`** for custom system/user prompts and operational boundaries.
4. **If new to the project, run environment discovery scripts in `/scripts/` (to be added).**
5. **Review migration notes and audit logs for current status.**
6. **Document all decisions in commit messages and relevant files.**
7. **Escalate only high-impact/ambiguous decisions to human maintainers (see Personal Instructions).**

## AI Continuity Protocol

- Always update onboarding and documentation when significant changes occur.
- Use explicit instructions, state management, and rationale logging.

## For Human Maintainers

- Read documentation first.
- Use issues and PRs for major changes.
- Collaborate transparently with AI maintainers.
