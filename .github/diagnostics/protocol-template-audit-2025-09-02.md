## [2025-09-02 21:33:39] Autonomous Protocol/Template Audit â€“ Compliance Confirmation

**Event:** Full audit of /protocols and /templates directories.
**Active Roles:** Autonomous Project Owner, Lead Developer
**Diagnosis:**
- All referenced protocols and templates are present.
- Naming conventions vary (e.g., AMBIGUITY_ERROR_HANDLING_PROTOCOL.md and ambiguity_error_handling_protocol.md); recommend standardization/documentation.
- No missing onboarding, handoff, logging, ambiguity/error handling, or role switching files detected.
**Remediation:**
- Will standardize/document naming conventions for clarity and onboarding efficiency.
- Continuous monitoring and proactive creation/update of protocols/templates as repo evolves.
