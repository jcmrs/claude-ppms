## [2025-09-02 21:31:33] Autonomous Protocol Self-Audit â€“ Error Handling & Feedback Response

**Event:** Repeated workflow/config errors, failure to suppress changelog CI PR creation, and missing diagnostics log entries.
**Active Roles:** Prompt Designer, Lead Developer
**Diagnosis:**
- Provided workflows did not address PR creation error (403) in changelog CI.
- Failed to update `.github/changelog-ci-config.yml` with explicit config to disable PR creation (if supported).
- Did not create diagnostics log entries as per /personal_instructions.md and onboarding protocol.
**Remediation:**
- Will always log self-audit/error events in diagnostics.
- Will propose explicit config and workflow adjustments to suppress PR creation, address 404/403 warnings, and improve error handling.
- Will consult PROMPTS.md before further troubleshooting.
**References:** /personal_instructions.md, /protocols/error-handling.md, PROMPTS.md consulted for troubleshooting.

## [2025-09-02 21:31:33] PROMPTS.md Consulted
- Reason: Error/ambiguity in workflow and changelog CI configuration, feedback from jcmrs, protocol switch required.
