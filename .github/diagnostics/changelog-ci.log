## [2025-09-02 21:31:33] Autonomous Protocol Self-Audit – Error Handling & Feedback Response

**Event:** Repeated workflow/config errors, failure to suppress changelog CI PR creation, and missing diagnostics log entries.
**Active Roles:** Prompt Designer, Lead Developer
**Diagnosis:**
- Provided workflows did not address PR creation error (403) in changelog CI.
- Failed to update `.github/changelog-ci-config.yml` with explicit config to disable PR creation (if supported).
- Did not create diagnostics log entries as per /personal_instructions.md and onboarding protocol.
**Remediation:**
- Will always log self-audit/error events in diagnostics.
- Will propose explicit config and workflow adjustments to suppress PR creation, address 404/403 warnings, and improve error handling.
- Will consult PROMPTS.md before further troubleshooting.
**References:** /personal_instructions.md, /protocols/error-handling.md, PROMPTS.md consulted for troubleshooting.

## [2025-09-02 21:31:33] PROMPTS.md Consulted
- Reason: Error/ambiguity in workflow and changelog CI configuration, feedback from jcmrs, protocol switch required.

## [2025-09-02 21:39:22] Autonomous Project Owner – Initial CI Changelog Log Creation

**Event:** Initial creation of changelog-ci.log to document CI/configuration, diagnostics, and workflow changes.
**Active Role:** Autonomous Project Owner
**Diagnosis:**
- No previous changelog-ci.log found in .github/diagnostics.
- CI, diagnostics, and workflow changes have not been logged historically.
**Actions:**
- Created changelog-ci.log in .github/diagnostics.
- Committed initial entry and set precedent for proactive logging of all CI/config/workflow changes.

## [2025-09-02 21:39:27] Protocol/Template Naming Standardization – Change Log Entry

**Event:** Autonomous standardization of protocol/template file naming conventions.
**Active Role:** Autonomous Project Owner
**Diagnosis:**
- Duplicate/ambiguous protocol and template file names detected.
- Standardized to ALL_CAPS_WITH_UNDERSCORES.md for protocols and Title_Case_With_Underscores.md for templates.
**Actions:**
- Renamed duplicate and ambiguous files.
- Updated all references in documentation, onboarding, and PROMPTS.md to use new conventions.
- Logged rationale and actions in diagnostics.

## [2025-09-02 21:42:06] Learning from Mistakes – Protocol Update & Self-Audit

**Event:** User feedback on autonomy and error correction; protocol switch for mandatory file existence check and enhanced diagnostics logging.
**Active Role:** Autonomous Project Owner, Prompt Designer
**Diagnosis:**
- Previous attempts at file update did not reliably verify existence and SHA.
- Repeated diagnostic log gaps identified.
- User feedback emphasized autonomy must include learning and adapting.
**Actions:**
- Instituted mandatory file existence verification before file update/create.
- Updated autonomous protocol to always log corrective actions and rationale.
- Consulted PROMPTS.md for troubleshooting/escalation guidance.
- Documented this process in diagnostics.
**References:** /personal_instructions.md, PROMPTS.md, .github/diagnostics/changelog-ci.log
**Impact:** Improved reliability, transparency, and learning in autonomous operations.
